#---------------------------------- 0.26.0 -----------------------------------
[added] support for Python 3.3 thanks to the six library and porting effort
    from Justin Mayfield https://github.com/mayfield, which also includes some
    additional tests.
[remove] String column from Python 3.3, use the Text column instead.
[changed] Both String and Text columns can use unique columns.
[fixed] rom's behavior with long ints in some situations.
[fixed] rom's behavior with unicode suffixes in Python 2.x.
[added] tests for unicode text indexes, unique indexes, prefix indexes, and
    suffix indexes.
[updated] relevant docs regarding the Text column and unique indexes.
[fixed] improperly labeled 0.25.1 release in this changelog.
#---------------------------------- 0.25.1 -----------------------------------
[fixed] an issue where Lua writing wouldn't properly update unique indexes on
    deletion was fixed. Thank you to https://github.com/thedrow for the
    report.
[changed] added a link to the full Python docs to the Readme.
#---------------------------------- 0.25.0 -----------------------------------
[changed] version numbers to account for bugfixes vs. feature updates.
[added] columns can now be defined to allow for prefix and/or suffix queries.
    Enabling prefix queries also enables arbitrary pattern matching over your
    data.
[fixed] in some cases, rom would allow the definition of multiple primary
    keys, of which only one would ever be used (inconsistently). This will now
    result in an error.
[changed] defaulted to assume Lua is available on Redis, which has been
    released for over 15 months at this point. You can disable support via
    a call to rom._disable_lua_writes().
[added] the ability to cache and get the key that holds the result of a query,
    which can be used for pagination, etc. See: Query.cached_result()
[warning] using rom versions of 0.23 with 0.25.0 when prefix and suffix
    indexes are enabled can result in improper results from prefix, suffix,
    and/or pattern queries, and can result in orphan data living in prefix or
    suffix indexes. Upgrade all of your clients!
[changed] temporary keys for queries are now prefixed with the name of the
    model over which queries are being executed on. This should effect
    basically zero people, but can allow for query cleanup in the off chance
    of a failure during execution.
#----------------------------- 0.23 (unreleased) -----------------------------
[changed] reduced number of round trips for single-filter queries by 1, thanks
    to https://github.com/MickeyKim for the report.
#----------------------------------- 0.22 ------------------------------------
[fixed] size estimation for intersection ordering when filtering has now been
    fixed, thank you to https://github.com/MickeyKim for the report and the
    change (should improve performance).
[fixed] an issue with some types when trying to update attributes has now been
    fixed, thank you to https://github.com/denisvolokh for the report.
[changed] improved performance for simple numeric range queries of the form
    Model.get_by(attr=value) or Model.get_by(attr=(min, max)) by roughly a
    factor of 60x or better in some cases. Thank you to
    https://github.com/MickeyKim for the report on poor performance.
#----------------------------------- 0.21 ------------------------------------
[fixed] upload for rom 0.20 was missing new columns.py, now fixed
#----------------------------------- 0.20 ------------------------------------
[changed] Added exception when performing .all(), .execute(), or .count() on
    query objects that have had no filters or attribute ordering provided.
    This addresses issue #12.
[changed] Moved column definitions to their own module, shouldn't affect any
    normal uses of rom.
[added] For users of Redis 2.6 and later, there is a beta Lua-enabled writing
    option that allows for multiple unique columns on models. In some cases,
    this may improve performance when writing many entities very quickly.
[added] The ability to reload an entity from Redis, optionally discarding any
    modifications to the object itself. Check out the documentation for
    Model.refresh(), Session.refresh(), and Session.refresh_all()
[added] Tests for the newly changed/added features.
[changed] Tests no longer use flushdb() - all test models/indexes/etc. are
    prefixed with RomTest, and we find/delete such keys before and after any
    tests are run. Now anyone can reasonably run the test suite.
#----------------------------------- 0.19 ------------------------------------
[fixed] Thanks to a bug report by https://github.com/MickeyKim , was notified
    of a bug when using unique indexes, which is now fixed and has a testcase.
#----------------------------------- 0.18 ------------------------------------
[fixed] Thanks to a bug report by https://github.com/MickeyKim , was notified
    and received an interim patch for a bug that could cause deleted entities
    to be resurrected on session.commit() or session.flush() . This has now
    been fixed and a testcase has been added.
#----------------------------------- 0.17 ------------------------------------
[added] LGPL 3 licensing option.
#----------------------------------- 0.16 ------------------------------------
[added] Thanks to a feature request from https://github.com/jrsmith , Boolean
    column support is now available.
[added] DateTime, Date, and Time column types because I was already adding
    Boolean columns.
#----------------------------------- 0.15 ------------------------------------
[fixed] Thanks to https://github.com/MickeyKim who fixed Json columns so that
    they round-trip after multiple saves.
#----------------------------------- 0.14 ------------------------------------
[fixed] Thanks to https://github.com/mayfield the manifest is fixed for the
    source installation.
#----------------------------------- 0.13 ------------------------------------
[fixed] updating a model will no longer unindex the model on attributes that
    weren't updated. Thanks to https://github.com/mayfield for the bug report,
    analysis, and initial pull request that ultimately resulted in the fix.
[fixed] pip requires, versioning, etc., thanks to fixes from
    https://github.com/mayfield
[changed] Model.get_by() will now work on any type of indexed columns. Unique
    columns work as before, and other columns get pass-through to the
    Model.query interface.
[changed] Model.get_by() and Model.query.filter() will both accept single
    numbers as the value to match on (you don't need to specify a range if you
    are querying by equality).
[changed] all changes will be documented in this changelog.txt file to keep a
    list of everything that is going on with the project.
