'''
Rom - the Redis object mapper for Python

Copyright 2013 Josiah Carlson

Released under the LGPL license version 2.1 and version 3 (you can choose
which you'd like to be bound under).


What
====

Rom is a package whose purpose is to offer active-record style data modeling
within Redis from Python, similar to the semantics of Django ORM, SQLAlchemy +
Elixir, Google's Appengine datastore, and others.

Why
===

I was building a personal project, wanted to use Redis to store some of my
data, but didn't want to hack it poorly. I looked at the existing Redis object
mappers available in Python, but didn't like the features and functionality
offered.

What is available
=================

Data types:

* Strings, ints, floats, decimals, booleans
* datetime.datetime, datetime.date, datetime.time
* Json columns (for nested structures)
* OneToMany and ManyToOne columns (for model references)

Indexes:

* Numeric range fetches, searches, and ordering
* Full-word text search (find me entries with col X having words A and B)

Other features:

* Per-thread entity cache (to minimize round-trips, easy saving of all
  entities)

Getting started
===============

1. Make sure you have Python 2.6 or 2.7 installed
2. Make sure that you have Andy McCurdy's Redis library installed:
   https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/ or
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis
3. (optional) Make sure that you have the hiredis library installed for Python
4. Make sure that you have a Redis server installed and available remotely
5. Update the Redis connection settings for ``rom`` via
   ``rom.util.set_connection_settings()`` (other connection update options,
   including per-model connections, can be read about in the ``rom.util``
   documentation)::

    import redis
    from rom import util

    util.set_connection_settings(host='myhost', db=7)

.. warning:: If you forget to update the connection function, rom will attempt
 to connect to localhost:6379 .

6. Create a model::

    class User(Model):
        email_address = String(required=True, unique=True)
        salt = String()
        hash = String()
        created_at = Float(default=time.time)

7. Create an instance of the model and save it::

    PASSES = 32768
    def gen_hash(password, salt=None):
        salt = salt or os.urandom(16)
        comp = salt + password
        out = sha256(comp).digest()
        for i in xrange(PASSES-1):
            out = sha256(out + comp).digest()
        return salt, out

    user = User(email_address='user@host.com')
    user.salt, user.hash = gen_hash(password)
    user.save()
    # session.commit() or session.flush() works too

8. Load and use the object later::

    user = User.get_by(email_address='user@host.com')
